 weâ€™ll build and deploy a complete coffee shop customer service AI chatbot that takes orders, provides menu info, blocks irrelevant conversations, and even recommends products based on Market Basket Analysis! We'll cover cutting-edge topics like Prompt Engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the modular power of Agent-Based Systems. You'll also learn how to deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) and custom APIs using RunPod, and build a full React Native app that connects to Firebase and the RunPod endpoints.
